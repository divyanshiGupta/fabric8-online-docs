Rules for this file:

This file is consumed for the automatic generation of infotips used by OSIO web components. Certain rules need to be observed.

* Only use the AsciiDoc syntax for a definition list to define terms.
* Don't capitalize terms arbitrarily.
* Use singulars for term names.
* Each term needs to be bracketed in the following:

  // term: $uuid, en
  // endterm

* When adding a new term, either use the `uuidgen` command on the CLI or use  https://www.uuidgenerator.net/ to generate a new UUID.
* Never change existing UUIDs; even when correcting the name of the term.
* Never remove terms, unless first agreed on with the respective OSIO team that uses its definition.
* Alphabetize the terms for easy orientation.
